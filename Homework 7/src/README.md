In this directory presented me attempts to build class to easily use my BERTopic pipeline with my postprocessing.

There are 2 files:
   - [`prompts.py`](prompts.py): contains 2 prompts templates for LLM
   - [`topic_modeling.py`](topic_modeling.py): contains `TopicModeling` class, which implements pipeline logic.
   - [`universal_approach.py`](universal_approach.py): realize simple example of `TopicModeling` class usage. It shows the pipeline of finding topics of each telegram channel.
